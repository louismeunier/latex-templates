# LaTeX Templates

The templates I use for notes and assignments in LaTeX. They contain quite a lot of comments and should thus hopefully be easy to use. 

The homework template was originally based off [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/homework-template/wyqwgcrfxktj) template, but has since been heavily modified.

To use them locally, you can use:

```bash
# assignment template
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louismeunier/latex-templates/main/ASSIGNMENT%20TEMPLATE.tex" > assignment.tex
```
```bash
# note template
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louismeunier/latex-templates/main/NOTE%20TEMPLATE.tex" > note.tex
```

Or simply download them directly.
